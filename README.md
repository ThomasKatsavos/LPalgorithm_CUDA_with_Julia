# LPalgorithm_CUDA_with_Julia
A Julia-based CUDA implementation for parallelizing Label Propagation algorithm. Originally developed in Google Colab, this repository refactors the code into a modular structure for better performance analysis and reproducibility as part of the Parallel and Distributed Systems (Project 3) class.
